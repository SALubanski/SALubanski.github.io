Hello, my name is Stan. I'm interested in solving questions with data and improving research methods. Currently I investigate questions related to uncertainty in randomized experiments through my work as a PhD Student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/) in the department of Educational Psychology.
